Home of simple to complex examples in different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

When I learn a new language, framework, or library, the examples their respective official site are often a good place to start but often fall short if I want to learn more. So I ended up with googling the web just to hunt down bits and pieces, and often it takes a long time.

This repository is created to solve that problem in mind.  If you have something you can share, feel free to fork it and create PRs.

# Folder structures
```
.
+-- <language>_<framework(s) or librar(ies)>
	+-- <Example>
		+--	README.md
		+-- <ExampleFoldersOrFiles>
+-- README.template.md // Use this to create the README.md for each example.	
```

Use the full name of the languages, frameworks, and libraries when naming the folders.  Users should able to understand the names at first glance.  These naming can also help SEO so that search engines can point users here. For example:

* `TypeScript` and `JavaScript` instead of `ts` and `js`
* `AngularJS` and `KnockoutJS` instead of 'ng' and 'ko'
* `jQuery`, `underscore`, and `lodash` instead of `$` and ...
